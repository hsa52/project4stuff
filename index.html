<H1>Greasers and Mushrooms</H1>
<div id = "gameport" ></div>
<H1>Instructions</H1>
<p>The mushrooms are back and badder than ever. They've stolen some of your essential greaser items.</p>
<p>But they've also left around some coins to pick up. Just for fun.<p>
<p>Avoid the mushrooms by jumping over them, collect the coins, get back your greaser items, and<br>defeat the Big Bad Mushroom at the end.<p>
<p>Use A and D to move left and right and use W to do a jump.<p>
<p>Avoid the mushrooms because if you hit them then it's game over.<p>
<p>Refresh to try again.<p>
<p>NOTE: You cannot hold W or press it more than once while jumping over a mushroom.<br>This will cause the game to crash.<p>
<p>P.S. Not all mushrooms are bad(but don't test that on every mushroom)<p>
